# DiluteDisorder

Repository for exact diagonalisation simulations of spin chains with dilute disorder. This repository currently contains the code used to run the simulations, and the code used to produce the plots in the accompanying paper (in the form of a Jupyter notebook).

Full data for this project will be uploaded on Zenodo in due course.
